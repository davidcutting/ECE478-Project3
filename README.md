## Producer and consumer problem

We have implemented a bounded buffer using semaphores. The consumer can not consume if the buffer is empty. The producer must first produce some data for the consumer. A semaphore is used to prevent the producer and consumer from interfering with one another while their critical sections are being executed. A producer must wait for the consumer to finish consuming before it produces again, and visa versa.

In the producer this is done with:

```C
sem_wait(&empty);
data = produced;
sem_post(&full);
```

In the consumer this is done with:

```C
sem_wait(&full);
total = total + data;
sem_post(&empty);
```

Adding a loop for creating and joining threads allows multiple producers and consumers. The buffer size can be changed via a command line parameter. This parameter is loaded into `bufferSize` and then used to initialize the empty semaphore, because an empty semaphore would have a size *n* with *n* being the maximum buffer size.
